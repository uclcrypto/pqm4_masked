# pqm4_masked
Post-quantum masked crypto library for the ARM Cortex-M4.
Currently, Kyber768 and saber are implemented.
See the [research paper](https://tches.iacr.org/index.php/TCHES/article/view/9831).

*This is an updated version to fix weaknesses identified by [Zeitschner et al.](https://eprint.iacr.org/2023/034).
For the version evaluated in the [paper](https://tches.iacr.org/index.php/TCHES/article/view/9831), see the `tches` tag.*

## Introduction
The **pqm4\_masked** library is based on [pqm4](https://github.com/mupq/pqm4).

The main differences are
* the addition of masked implementations of the following schemes:
    - Kyber768 (in `crypto_kem/kyber768/m4fspeed_masked`, tested on the `nucleo-l4r5zi` target);
    **/!\\This implementation is provided for demonstration and benchmarking purposes.
    It has NOT been subjected to any leakage assessment. Use it at your own risk./!\\**
    - SABER (in `crypto_kem/saber/m4fspeed_masked`, tested on the `nucleo-l4r5zi` target);
    **/!\\This implementation is provided for demonstration and benchmarking purposes.
    It has NOT been subjected to any leakage assessment. Use it at your own risk./!\\**

* some changes in the tooling to allow for finer-grained benchmarking and testing
  (for this, we use a slightly modified version of the `mupq` submodule located
  at <https//github.com/uclcrypto/mupq>).

The provided code has not been extensively optimized. Simple programming tricks can improve the 
performances, especially for small number of shares. 

## Setup/Installation

Same as [pqm4](https://github.com/mupq/pqm4).


## API documentation
For the purpose of simple testing and benchmarking, the **pqm4\_masked**
library uses the NIST/SUPERCOP/[PQClean
API](https://github.com/PQClean/PQClean).
(See [pqm4](https://github.com/mupq/pqm4).)

**/!\\As a result, the secret key is stored unmasked, which is insecure./!\\**

**/!\\The epheremal (encapsulated) key is also unprotected similarly as [this paper](https://tches.iacr.org/index.php/TCHES/article/view/9064)./!\\**

## Running tests and benchmarks

In addition to pqm4 common testing (`testvectors.py` and benchmarking `benchmarking.py`), `pqm4\_masked` supports:
* testing a single implementation (e.g. `kyber768/m4fspeed_masked` as command-line parameter)
* benchmarking components of the masked implementation `subspeed` in `benchmarks.py`

### Example usages

Before running any code, run `cd libopencm3; make; cd ..`, otherwise the scripts fail.

```shell
# Testvectors
CFLAGS="-DNSHARES=2" python3 testvectors.py -p nucleo-l4r5zi --uart /dev/ttyACM0 kyber768/m4fspeed_masked
# Benchmark whole
CFLAGS="-DNSHARES=2 -DBENCH=0" python3 benchmarks.py -p nucleo-l4r5zi --uart /dev/ttyACM0 kyber768/m4fspeed_masked --speed
# Benchmark components
CFLAGS="-DNSHARES=2 -DBENCH=1" python3 benchmarks.py -p nucleo-l4r5zi --uart /dev/ttyACM0 kyber768/m4fspeed_masked --subspeed
```

By default, the implementations use a mix of C and Assembly (implementation
`S3` and `K3` in the research paper). In order to enforce the usage of pure C
implementation, the `CFLAGS` must contain `-DUSEC`. With the `USEC` defined,
the implementations `S2` and `K2` are used.

### Benchmarks

You can run all the benchmarks for `saber` or `kyber768`, then show a plot of
the results by runing:

```shell
./run_bench.sh kyber768 
python3 parse_bench.py kyber768 asm
python3 parse_bench.py kyber768 c
```

### Profiling framework

We provide a profiling framework that measures the execution time of
sub-parts of the implementations.
To configure the measured parts, first edit `BENCH_CASES` in
`common/bench.h` (we provide a reasonable default).

Example (to measure `my_function` and `my_other_function`):
```c
#define BENCH_CASES X(my_function) X(my_other_function)
```

Then you increase the performance counter of that part where it is called:
```c 
start_bench(my_function);
my_function(...); // This can be any block of code you want to measure.
stop_bench(my_function);
```
See also `common/bench.c` and `common/speed_sub.c` for additional details about
the profiling framework. 

Note that the profiling framework can be configured with `define`s (e.g. using
`CFLAGS` configuration).
To activate the profiling framework, the flag `BENCH=1` must be defined.
In order to measure randomness usage instead of cycle count, `BENCH_RND=1` must be defined.
